Each pathogen is then integrated with the unstimulated, 3h and 24h condition. This is then clustered and marker gene expression is plotted. Marker gene expression then determines the cell type of each cluster. These classifications are the transferred back into the object containing all conditions. (per pathogen and chemistry=6h@220GB)
